# Iterative and Incremental SDLC Diagram
## ASPIRE AI PATHFINDER Project

This diagram can be drawn on paper using boxes, arrows, and circles. Here's how to draw it step by step:

---

## Drawing Instructions

### Main Structure

1. Draw a large circle in the center. This represents the iterative cycle.

2. Divide the circle into 6 segments (like a pie) for the 6 phases:
   - Requirements Analysis
   - Design
   - Implementation
   - Testing
   - Deployment
   - Review & Feedback

3. Draw curved arrows inside the circle connecting each segment to the next, going clockwise.

4. Draw a spiral arrow from "Review & Feedback" back to "Requirements Analysis" to show iteration.

### Increments Timeline

5. On the left side, draw a vertical timeline with boxes for each increment:

   ```
   [Increment 1: Auth & Database]
            |
            v
   [Increment 2: File Upload]
            |
            v
   [Increment 3: AI Integration]
            |
            v
   [Increment 4: Role Suggestions]
            |
            v
   [Increment 5: Career Explorer]
            |
            v
   [Increment 6: AI Chat]
   ```

6. From each increment box, draw an arrow pointing to the central circle, showing each increment goes through all phases.

    Each increment goes through all phases in the cycle.
    After review, either start next increment or refine current one.
```

## Key Elements to Show

### Arrows:
- **Horizontal arrows** from increment boxes to the cycle: Shows each increment enters the development cycle
- **Curved arrows** within the cycle: Shows sequential flow through phases
- **Backward arrow** from Review to Requirements: Shows iteration

### Labels:
- Label each increment with what feature it adds
- Label each phase in the cycle
- Add a note: "Cycle repeats for each increment"

### Additional Notes on Diagram:

Add these annotations around the drawing:

- Near Increment boxes: "Each increment adds working functionality"
- Near the cycle: "All increments follow the same development cycle"
- Near the backward arrow: "Iterate based on feedback"
- At bottom: "Final product = Sum of all increments"

## Color Coding (if using colors)

- Increments: Light blue boxes
- Cycle phases: Different color for each (rainbow)
- Arrows: Black
- Iteration arrow: Red (to highlight the feedback loop)

## Simplified Hand-Drawn Version

For a quick sketch on paper:

1. Draw 6 boxes stacked vertically on the left (increments)
2. Draw a circle on the right with "Plan → Design → Code → Test → Deploy → Review" written around it
3. Draw arrows from each box to the circle
4. Draw a curved arrow from "Review" back to "Plan"
5. Write "Repeat for each increment" at the bottom

That's it. Simple, clear, and shows the key idea: multiple increments, each going through an iterative cycle.
